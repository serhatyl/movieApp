# Movie App

Movie App is a web application that allows users to discover movies. This app is built using React, TypeScript, and Webpack, and uses JSON Server to provide mock API data.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the Movie App in your local development environment.

### Requirements

- Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
